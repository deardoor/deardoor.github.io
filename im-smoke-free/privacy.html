    <title>Privacy Policy - I'm Smoke-Free</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective date: January 2, 2026</p>

    <p>
        I'm Smoke-Free (the "App") is developed and operated by DearDoor Studio ("we", "us", or "our").
        This Privacy Policy explains what information the App uses and how it is handled.
        The App is designed as a personal tool to help you track your smoke-free time,
        estimate money saved, and illustrate potential health benefits based on public
        information from the World Health Organization (WHO).
    </p>

    <h2>1. What this app does</h2>
    <p>
        I'm Smoke-Free helps you record your quit date and smoking history, and then
        calculates:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How long you have stayed smoke-free.</li>
        <li>How much money you may have saved by not buying cigarettes.</li>
        <li>
            A theoretical view of health improvement milestones, inspired by WHO and
            other public health information (for example: heart and lung benefits over time).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Data you enter</h2>
    <p>To provide these calculations, the App allows you to manually enter information such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your quit date or time you stopped smoking.</li>
        <li>Your previous smoking habits (for example, cigarettes per day or packs per week).</li>
        <li>Approximate price of cigarettes in your region.</li>
        <li>Optional settings related to how the app calculates money saved and milestones.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All of this information is entered by you. You can review, update, or delete it at any time
        inside the App (depending on the features available in your current version).
    </p>

    <h2>3. No personally identifiable information</h2>
    <p>
        The App is intentionally designed to work without collecting information that directly
        identifies you. In particular:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not ask for your real name, email address, phone number, postal address, or ID number.</li>
        <li>We do not access your contacts, photos, messages, or other personal content on your device.</li>
        <li>We do not require you to create an account or log in.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Where your data is stored</h2>
    <p>
        All data you enter in I'm Smoke-Free is stored locally on your device.
        It is used only inside the App to perform calculations and display your progress.
        We do not operate separate servers that receive or store your personal progress data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Depending on your device settings, your data may be included in system-level backups
        (for example, iCloud, Google backup, or other vendor backup services).
        Those backups are controlled by your operating system provider, and their privacy
        policies apply to that backup process.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Analytics, advertising, and third-party services</h2>
    <p>
        The current version of I'm Smoke-Free does not include in-app advertising and does not
        integrate third-party analytics SDKs that track you across apps or websites.
    </p>
    <p>
        If this changes in a future version, we will update this Privacy Policy and clearly
        describe what information is collected, for what purpose, and how you can control it.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data retention and deletion</h2>
    <p>
        Your smoke-free history and settings are kept on your device for as long as you use the App.
        You can usually reset your data from within the App (if a reset option is available),
        or remove all app data by uninstalling the App from your device.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Children</h2>
    <p>
        I'm Smoke-Free is a utility app focused on health-related self-tracking for adults.
        It is not designed for children under the age that applies in your region
        (for example, under 13 years old in many countries).
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App
        or in applicable laws. When we make important changes, we will update the "Effective date"
        at the top of this page. In some cases, we may also notify you inside the App.
    </p>
